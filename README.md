OSM TagInspect

Demo at http://maproulette.org/ti

This needs a geoserver backend.

I will upload the geoserver config file, how is that?

This assumes an osmosis snapshot + linestring postgis database on the geoserver backend. In my setup, the credentials for that database are osm/osm.

You will at the very least need to change the base URL to the geoserver WMS endpoint in the HTML.

This is not meant to be pretty!
